# OSCMusicVisualizer for Blender

Procedurally Generated Music Graphics


 - While they're displayed as a 2D shape the real-time graphics are made in a 3D setup. It can theoretically run uninterrupted for 9 hours before resetting back to frame 0 and restarting all over again. All shapes are created procedurally with the values fed by Processing via OSC.

      - Color and some graphic elements other than the shape can be changed to several presets on the click of a button, drastically changing the mood of the displayed images which in turn, blends better with the chosen music.
